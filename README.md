# Unhandled Exception in Dart Network Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: inadequate error handling during asynchronous network operations. The provided code snippet attempts to fetch data from a remote API, but only includes minimal error handling within the `try-catch` block. 

**Problem:** The `catch` block simply prints the error to the console.  In a real-world application, this is insufficient.  Users should receive informative feedback, and the app should ideally implement retry mechanisms or gracefully handle failures.

**Solution:** The `bugSolution.dart` file showcases a more robust approach, providing specific error handling based on HTTP status codes and offering a better user experience.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in asynchronous Dart code for building reliable and user-friendly applications.
